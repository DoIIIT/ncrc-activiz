MIC BREAKOUT BOARD (Shortside across rows)
- AUD to A1 on Arduino
- GND to opposite side of breadboard on same row as resistor (4.7K)
- VCC to [+] on  opposite side of breadboard

RESISTOR
- One end in same row with Mic Breakout Board’s ground
- Other end several rows up in same column
- Wire in adjacent column (same row) as other end of resistor reaching back across the breadboard to [-]

LED STRIP
- Brown to same [-] column as the mic breakout board’s grounding (via resistor)
- Blue to [+] on opposite side of breadboard (same column as mic breakout board’s VCC)
- Green to Pin 3 on Arduino
- Red to Pin 2 on Arduino

ARDUINO
- Wire from 5V to [+] in same column as mic breakout board’s VCC
- Wire from GND to [-] in same column as the mic breakout board’s grounding (via resistor)
