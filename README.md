NCRC Activiz
=================

This is an Arduino LED visualization project which will be installed at
the University of Michigan's North Campus Research Complex (NCRC). The Taubman
School of Architecture is designing and installing a collaborative space
at the NCRC which will be complemented with ambient LED visualizations.
These visualizations will be controlled via Arduino and will reflect the
sound and motion within and surrounding the collaborative space.
