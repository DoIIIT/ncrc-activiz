## SIMPLE PIR CIRCUIT LAYOUT

# From Arduino
• Wire directly from GND to Ground “port” on PIR
• Wire from VIN (need to power from wall) to same row on breadboard as power output wire from Power “port” on PIR
• Wire from Pin 3 to same row on breadboard signal output wire from Signal “port” on PIR

# Breadboard
• Wire from VIN in same row adjacent to to power wire out to PIR
• 10K resistor jumping across breadboard hemispheres
• On opposite site of breadboard: wire from Pin 3 in same row adjacent to to signal wire in from PIR

# From PIR
• Black = Signal
• Brown = Ground
• Red = Power
